# IMDb Search Engine

This project includes a working app. The data I used can be found here(https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset). This app is still work in progress.
So far, the app recommends top 12 movies based on genre, description, language, and actors. Due to the size of the data, This only includes about 47,000 movies with English as language or as one of the languages.

## Problems
 
The dataset is too large for me to run on my local. There was a constant trouble with Jupyter Lab and VSCode to run large files.

## Things to be included

Different types of recommendation. I want to include the four features separately as an option to give users better result based on their perspective. Once again, due to the large dataset, I was not able to get image links for the movies. The legend says the cell is still running (it really is. 28th hour). I would like to add them. Result page templates need to be polished a bit more.
